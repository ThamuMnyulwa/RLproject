# RLproject

The goal of this project was to investigate reinforcement learning(RL). This is another paragdim in machine learning along supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The notebooks contained in this file are a mixture of the notes written on RL along with the code used in a final report and a few derivations. Note the litrature here focuses explicitly on RL and does not go into deep reinforcement learning. The idea is that after completing the research one can return to this file at a later stage in order to recap on reinfircement learning litrature. I've placed it here in case anyone else is following the same path and the hope is that it could help them move faster than myself.

Most of these notebooks are written extremely informally as they were written primaly for myself to understand RL, however I hope that they can be some benefit to someone else. 


### Litrature on RL
Here I provide some of the litrature, classes/courses, talks/tutorials, and others (git source code and posts). There are two main text books on RL,  [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf) and [Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/papers/RLAlgsInMDPs-lecture.pdf). The former is longer to read and is suitable for most but the second is more mathamatical and seemed to present the theory well. If Implementation is your intrest I would go with the former rather than the latter.
